There are still improvements that are need to be made:

BE:
- Using a webpack to reduce package size
- REST API documentation
- Migrating to polka from express (polka is more lighweight)
- Implement pagination, because right now there is a 5 post limit and no option to view older posts
- Research about serverless packaging
- proper request and response validation
- some logger

FE:
- Everything
